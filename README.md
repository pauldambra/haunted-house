# Node now has async/await

This is a node project that let's you check if a house is haunted. It uses many Promises because of the length of time one must stay in a house to determine if and how haunted it is. Detecting ghosts is a slow business that requires lots of patience.

But Promises are _so_ last year. async/await is the new hotness.

# The challenge is...

...to convert the project to async/await without ever having more than one failing test.

# to run the

## program

`npm run` (note how the results arrive out of order because of the delays in ghost detection)

## tests

`npm test`

# strong opinions weakly held
