# Node now has async/await

This is a node project that let's you check if a house is haunted. It uses Promises because of the length of time one must stay in a house to determine if and how haunted it is.

But Promises are so last year. async/await is the new hotness.

# The challenge is...

...to convert the project to async/await without ever having more than one failing test.
